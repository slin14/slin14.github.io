## About Me

**I have a passion for leading edge technologies and the ability to learn extremely quickly.** I worked 8 months at Intel as ASIC Design and Verification Automation Co-op. On top of a full course load, I worked as a robotics researcher for [UBC Collaborative Advanced Robotics and Intelligent Systems (CARIS) Lab](https://caris.mech.ubc.ca/). I am a payload designer on [UBC Unmanned Aircraft Systems](https://www.ubcuas.com/) developing drone systems and unmanned ground vehicles. I also founded and currently lead the [Surrey Robotics Innovation Lab](https://surreyroboticsinnovationlab.ca/), a community organzation to empower youth in robotics.

I'm from Vancouver BC, and my hobbies include longboard dancing, photography, oil painting, basketball, oboe, and skiing.
