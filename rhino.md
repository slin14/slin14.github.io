## Rhino - Unmanned Ground Vehicle

**Project Summary:** 
* Affiliated Group: UBC Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UBC UAS)
* Purpose: To develop a fully autonomous unmanned ground vehicle (UGV) capable of retrieving medical packages identified by QR codes and delivering the packages to the drone. Additionally, develop the mechanisms to secure the UGV and packages to the drone during flight and release them at the landing sites. All objectives needed to be accomplished while maintaining a lightweight design and meeting the space and aerodynamic requirements of the payload system of the aircraft.

### 1. Suggest hypotheses about the causes of observed phenomena

```javascript
if (isAwesome){
  return true
}
```

### 2. Assess assumptions on which statistical inference will be based

```javascript
if (isAwesome){
  return true
}
```

### 3. Support the selection of appropriate statistical tools and techniques
