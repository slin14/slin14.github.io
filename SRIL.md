## Surrey Robotics Innovation Lab

I founded Surrey Robotics Innovation Lab (SRIL) in February 2019. It is my vision for creating a centre of innovation to empower youth through STEM education and innovation projects.

In November, 2020, SRIL partnered with UBC Geering Up to host an all-girls robotics coding event, called Robotics Today. The SRIL team taught over 50 grade 9 girls how to program robots in a virtual VEX Robotics simulator.
